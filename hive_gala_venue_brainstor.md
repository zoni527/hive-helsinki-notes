# Gala venue

## To consider
- Minimum size
    - How many people at least?
    - Educated guess at this point, at least 50
        - Ask for last gala attendance number and double it
    - Condusive to multiple things happening in the same space at the same time
        - Not too many things though, always splits the group and potential for chaos
- Accessibility
    - Lift or ground floor
    - Ramps/not too many stairs
    - Lighting
    - Not smelly
        - Go there before to find out
- Location
    - Accessible by public transport
    - Reasonable travel time
    - Distance to possible catering service
- Available on week days
- Available hours (how early? -> evening)
- Amenities
    - Tables
    - Plates
    - Lights
    - Sound system
    - Screen/projector/stage
- Price

## Possible locations
- Does Supercell have some venue?
    - Or some other partner? OP?
    - Let's ask!
- Restaurants
- Conference centers
- Some mansion
- Bars (bad for sponsors?)
- School sport hall (spartan)
- Some place with a sauna
