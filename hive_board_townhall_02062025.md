# Hive townhall with board 2.6.2025

## Questions for the board
- What do you see as necessary skills for programmers in the near future?
- I'm wondering if Hive is producing just a few exceptional coders that
will succeed and the leftovers won't be able to find employment. Do you
think there is still a market for other coders than superstars?
- Apart from software development are there any stem or other fields to
gain more experience in (data, communication, business, design etc.)?
