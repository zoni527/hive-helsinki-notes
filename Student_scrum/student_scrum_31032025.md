# Student scrum 31.3.2025

I'm not an expert in scrum or git. So I asked myself how could I provide value
for my fellow scrum meeting attendants?

I decided to do some research, as well as writing down some ideas what I could
do.

## Ideas what to cover

- Review projects
    - Require everyone to create at least one issue
    - Review the issues created
- Review scrum meetings
    - Are you satisfied overall?
    - What is good?
    - What is bad?
    - What kinda topics should be covered?
        - More abstract topics?
        - More concrete topics?
    - Is one session per week a good amount or too much?
- git
    - How to resolve conflicts in more depth
    - How to review a pull request
        - How to edit the pull request in place to fix
        what the comment says
    - lazygit
- Project breakdown exercise
    - Game: Multiplayer game of tag/infectious tag
    - Bot: Automated job alerts
    - Bot: Automated job applications
    - Embedded project: Alarm clock
    - Embedded project: Calculator
    - Embedded project: Electronic compass 
    - Embedded project: Music visualizer
    - App: Pomodoro timer
    - App: Scrum management
